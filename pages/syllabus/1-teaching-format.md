## Teaching

Seminars, workshops, studio teaching.

We meet on Fridays from 13.00-15.00 in the social space. You are expected to attend all classes. If you cannot make it to class please email [om.palmer@avans.nl](mailto:om.palmer@avans.nl) in advance. Failure to attend 2 classes without a valid excuse is grounds for failing the course.

The total time allocated for a 3EC course is 84 hours. This means that you are also expected to carry out around 6-7 hoursâ€™ work on your assignments outside of class time. 

There will be activities, conversations, presentations, feedback, and group work in class. Please try to engage with these activities as fully as possible. If for any reason you feel uncomfortable with these activities please let your tutor know.
