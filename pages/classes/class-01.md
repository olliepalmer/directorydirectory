## Activity 1: Course Rules

This course is about creating rules in your work which enable you to be more creative. It is inspired by the Oulipo, who worked with constrained writing techniques. 

A course about rules needs some rules. Some of these will be imposed on you (these are mostly there to make sure we’re all shooting in the same format, etc). Some we’ll make together. Some you’ll make yourself. Some will apply to all of us, some to just you.


### Imposed rules

*   We will shoot in 16:9, landscape format. You can edit your footage into other formats later, but start in this format. This means if you’re shooting on a phone, you hold it in horizontally!
*   We write, shoot, and edit _fast_. We are not precious about showing our work, or work-in-progress. We acknowledge it’s not going to be perfect, and constructive criticism will make it better.
*   We make something small every day. It doesn’t have to be great: it just has to be made.
*   We share our work with each other.
*   Rules help us make things.
*   If in doubt, make.
*   Ask for feedback.


### Your rules



*   Collectively agreed arbitrary rules. How do we refer to each other? Are we a class, a collective? What is our mission statement? 
*   What’s the best way of working? How can we share files? 
    *   A big Dropbox?
    *   Agree on naming convention + folder structure for our daily files (e.g. _ollie-daily-2019.09.27.mov_). **This will be important later!**
*   Any other rules?


## Activity 2: Video-making

You will be allocated a card with a word on it. You have ten minutes, working on your own, to make a 1-5 second film which captures the essence of the word. Do not tell anyone else what your word is. The shorter your film is, the better. You can use any film-making technique you want.

Words: gravity / acceleration / explosion / energy / implosion / clarity / transition / multiplication / fast / slow

After 10 minutes:

Upload your video here: [j.mp/2ld7wfP](http://j.mp/2ld7wfP) (make your first name the word, your second name “1”. Use your Avans email address.)

_This is a Dropbox file request._

Write a set of instructions that someone else can follow to make the same film you just made. Think about how precise or loose your language is. Do you want them to frame objects in a certain way? Do they need to carry out a certain set of movements? How can you capture these in writing? (5 minutes)

Pass your instructions to the person to your left. 

You have ten minutes to make a film by following the instructions you now have.

After 5 minutes:

Upload your video here: [j.mp/2ld7wfP](http://j.mp/2ld7wfP) (make your first name the word, your second name “2”. Use your Avans email address.)

Presentation of films, 1 then 2. Discussion: which instructions worked? Which films worked?


## Activity 3: Rules-based video

Create a simple set of constraints or rules you can follow to make videos with a recognisable visual or temporal structure. 

You will use these rules to make and upload a _new video every single day for the duration of this course_. Each video should be the same length (aim for 1-10 seconds). You must follow your own rules for every video. Think about how each video communicates your constraints, and connects to the overall form and structure of the other films in your series.

Write your instructions on a credit-card-sized card. Carry this in your wallet. Refer to it every time you make your video.

Your videos will not be perfect. You must be at peace with this. Your daily videos must not use any post-production, besides trimming clips so that they conform to the time standards.

You will have made 70 short videos by the end of this course. At the end of the course you will combine these videos into a composition which shows a logical ordering of information.

We will make our rules now and test them so you can be happy with this way of working. You’ll finalise your rules before the end of class.

As a guide, this exercise should take no more than 10 minutes each day. If you can make it something that gets your blood pumping or your creativity going, it will set you up for a good day of work!

A few sample rules:



*   _Each film will depict a single thin straight line running horizontally through its centre_
*   _Each film will depict a single, unbroken lateral 360º movement of the environment I am in a 12.36pm_
*   _Each film will depict a transition through a doorway_
*   _Each film will show me engaging with a mechanism_
*   _Each film will depict a balloon bursting in a new context  _
*   _Each film will show an unbroken shot of the back of someone’s head for five seconds_
*   _I am going to film the sky for one second at the same time every day_
*   _I am going to make a timelapse of drawing blindfolded, filmed from above_
*   _I am going to film a new orange object falling from my desk every day_
*   _I am going to film pouring a new drink every day_
*   _I am going to screw a piece of paper into a new ball every day; the camera position will always be the same_

# Homework assignments

Homework this week:

*   Daily rules-based videos. Upload these every day.
*   Put your daily rules into the [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-7oXTFJ9Phh1xanO6zaeC3hghGAFVKeIkASXCuLEsS4/edit?usp=sharing)! You can upload a photo of your card too.
*   [Research: Script-based artworks](#assignment-script-based-artworks)



### Assignment: Script-based artworks

Along with our daily videos, we will build a compendium of rules-based artworks across all media. This will be done in Google Slides, a platform where we can all collaborate on one big document.

You must find and describe two rules-based artworks. These can be performances, writing, paintings, sculptures, films, manifestos, games, or anything else you can think of. The rules can be something that creates a work of art, or rules themselves.

Make sure you check that nobody else is covering the same subject. Write it on a new slide in the Google Slides document as soon as you have an idea.

As you’re looking for works, ask yourself:



*   What rules are there? 
*   What are the rules for? Do they aid creation? When are they used?
*   How are the rules presented? Do the rules themselves form part of the work?
