# Assignments

## Rules-based films

Over the next week, you must work with your partner to make two films of equal length based on the two sets of rules you have (one set of rules you created, one set of rules another group created).

Your films must also follow the following rules:

- Your films must be the same length
- Your films must have cuts in the same places
- Your films must embody the essence of their subjects â€“ the audience should be able to _feel_ the subject  
- Your films must have a story arc (beginning/middle/end)
