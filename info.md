## Overview

This course aims to immerse students in the processes and techniques of film-based visual storytelling, whilst introducing students to Oulipo-inspired constrained design processes. 

Over the course of ten weeks, students make a series of short films, guided by rules that they create. Over time, both rules and films increase in length and complexity. For the initial films, students are assigned a subject matter, and have to devise a set of rules to shape the film they make. For example, students making a film about gravity might decide that the camera must always be moving downward, or swinging from a pendulum, or can only be made whilst the camera operator is falling over, etc. 

The students make a series of these extremely short films both in class and in their own time, then present to, and provide feedback to their peers. This is intended to enable students not to be precious about the presentation of filmic work; the legibility of the rules used to create the films will be more important than the outcome of the films themselves. The films become a visual diary of constrained design processes, and each student will build a body of work that consists of \~70 short films.

Later this same process is expanded; students work in small groups to devise rules, and write, produce, and edit short films of increased length which combine multiple subjects. Students devise a set of rules which will inform every decision they make throughout the scripting, shooting, and editing process. 

Throughout the course, students must document their process, present their works-in-progress, and provide feedback to peers about processes used. The course culminates in a public screening party of all films made during the course.

## Aims

This course aims to:

- Enable students to explore radical design processes, including the use of extreme constraints to create new working methodologies and drive creativity
- Frame design process as equally important to design outcomes, and develop students’ ability to describe and document those processes
- Immerse students in visual storytelling
- Improve students’ skills in writing, shooting, and editing films
- Improve students’ ability to work in groups
- Develop students’ ability and willingness to present work in progress (and frame conversations around process rather than outcome)
- Develop students’ ability to provide feedback to peers

## Material outcomes

- \~70 short themed films of 1-5 seconds per student
- 1 edited compilation of the short ‘daily’ films per student
- 2 short films, plus associated anaytical diagrams, scripts, etc

## Teaching format

Seminars, workshops, studio teaching.
We meet on Fridays from 13.00-15.00 in the social space. You are expected to attend all classes. If you cannot make it to class please email [om.palmer@avans.nl][3] in advance. Failure to attend 2 classes without a valid excuse is grounds for failing the course.

The total time allocated for a 3EC course is 84 hours. This means that you are also expected to carry out around 6-7 hours’ work on your assignments outside of class time. 

## Participation

There will be activities, conversations, feedback, and group work in class. Please try to engage with these activities as fully as possible. 


## Marking

Your work will be graded on 6th December 2019 by a panel consisting of your tutor and 1-2 other people. The course is a pass/fail, but you will be provided with feedback on your work.

When assessing your work, we will consider:

- your embracing of the rules-based practice your  


## Inclusivity

This course is designed to further your creativity and allow you to explore new ideas, techniques, and concepts. 

In order to do this, we need to make sure that everybody feels able to express themselves in a safe environment. At AKV St Joost we embrace an atmosphere of creativity which is enriched and enhanced by diversity along a number of dimensions, including race, ethnicity and national origins, gender and gender identity, sexuality, class and religion. We are especially committed to increasing the representation of those populations which have historically been excluded from participation in Dutch higher education. 

It is critical that each class member show respect for all world-views expressed in class. If you feel that something said or done in class is troubling or has caused discomfort, please contact Ollie confidentially. If you would like to speak to someone outside of the classroom, please contact Study Coach [Rosie Heinrich][4].

If you have a name or pronoun which differs from the one we have on record, please let me know. Like many people, I am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities, and am always eager to hear from students how I can improve in this respect.

If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please speak to Ollie or Rosie. Ollie is also available for individual tutorials on Fridays outside of class for students across MIVC.

## Tutor

Ollie Palmer is an artist, designer and film-maker whose work critically questions control systems and contemporary use of technology, and takes place across installations, films and performances. Projects often include collaborations with scientists, dancers, and other people outside of his own discipline. From 2015-16 he was Pavillon artist-in-residence at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris, and his work has been shown internationally (V&A Museum, Seoul Museum of Art, Opera Garnier de Paris). He holds a PhD by Design from the Bartlett School of Architecture entitled ‘Scripted performances: designing performative architectures through digital and absurd machines’, and is alumni of the Bartlett’s Interactive Architecture Lab. He has taught at the School of the Art Institute Chicago, the Bartlett, TU Delft Architecture, and AKV St Joost.
